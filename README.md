# Chrome Extension: reddit Video Right-Click to Download

Enables right-click to reddit video for easy download.

### TODO:

- Auto-download file instead of opening video to new tab
- Only enable right-click on video container instead of any reddit page
- Download highest quality video instead of assuming first option
- Migrate xml2json to external file
